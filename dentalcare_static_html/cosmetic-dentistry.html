They can be used on either front or back teeth. They are a good choice for people who prefer that their fillings look more natural.

It generally takes longer to place a composite filling than it does for a metal filling. That’s because composite fillings require the tooth be kept clean and dry while the cavity is being filled. Tooth-colored fillings are now used more often than amalgam or gold fillings, probably due to cosmetics. In a society focused on a white, bright smile, people tend to want fillings that blend with the natural color of their teeth.

<h1>Flexible partial denture</h1>
The development of flexible partial denture materials has allowed dentists to rethink the possibilities of long-term treatment of partial edentulism. These materials can be used without the concurrent weaknesses of methylmethacrylate (ie, frequent fracture, poor retention, lack of stability) or the technical difficulties and expense of metal castings. It is the purpose of this article to review the previously introduced clasps that have been found to be exceptionally functional with flexible partial design and to introduce new variations in clasping and design expectations.

<strong>Valplast</strong>

Valplast is a flexible, nylon thermoplastic that is thinner and more translucent than traditional partials. Doctors appreciate the minimal prep, easy insertion and long term strength. Patients love Valplast’s metal-free comfort and natural appearance.

&nbsp;

<strong>TCS </strong>

The TCS Unbreakable RPDs are thin, flexible, lightweight, and extremely comfortable. Doctors and patients enjoy the unparalleled simplicity, comfort and aesthetics. Today, more and more dental practitioners are relying on nylon-based removable partial dentures for their patients. Acrylic denture bases are hard and they can break. In addition, partials that contain metal clasps can be unsightly, causing many patients to feel self-conscious about the way they look. Partials utilizing cast clasps are becoming increasingly undesirable to patients who want to limit the amount of metal in their mouth.
<h1>Non-metal crown</h1>
<strong>E.Max</strong>

The E-Max crown is a type of all-ceramic crown which is preferred for its longer lasting, aesthetic qualities. This crown and the Zirconia crown are worn due to their highly attractive appearance which ensures that they compliment the rest of your teeth.

It is considered a good option for damaged, stained or poor quality teeth.

This is a type of all-ceramic crown with an appealing translucent colour which is combined with extra strength and durability.

This crown is made from a single block of lithium disilicate ceramic: this is a top grade material which has been harvested for its toughness, durability and opaque qualities .

Plus it is considered a breakthrough in dental crown technology.

&nbsp;

<strong>Zirconia</strong>

Zirconia (Zirconium Oxide) is a white powdered metal used to create dental frameworks for crowns, bridges and other dental substructures. It replaces gold or stainless steel used in the past, creates the appearance of a whiter more translucent tooth, and is transparent in xrays. Zirconia has been in use in cosmetic dentistry for many years to acheive the most aesthetic result possible, but has more recently become widely accepted as the dental material of choice.

Zirconia Crowns: Zirconia is the best material available for bridges and for creating a strong translucent tooth that rivals all-porcelain crowns.
<h1>Veneers</h1>
Dental veneers (sometimes called porcelain veneers or dental porcelain laminates) are wafer-thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to cover the front surface of teeth to improve your appearance. These shells are bonded to the front of the teeth changing their color, shape, size, or length.

Dental veneers can be made from porcelain or from resin composite materials. Porcelain veneers resist stains better than resin veneers and better mimic the light reflecting properties of natural teeth. Resin veneers are thinner and require removal of less of the tooth surface before placement. You will need to discuss the best choice of veneer material for you with your dentist.</div>
