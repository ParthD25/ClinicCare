<h1>TMJ/TMD disorders</h1>
More than 15 percent of American adults suffer from chronic facial pain, such as jaw pain, headaches or earaches.

The source of these aches and pains may be related to one or both of the temporomandibular (TM) joints. Located on each side of the head, these joints work together, with a complex system of muscles, ligaments, discs and bones, to make different movements for chewing and speaking.
<h2>What is TMD?</h2>
Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) refers to a variety of conditions that affect TM joints, jaw muscles and facial nerves. TMD may occur when the jaw twists during opening, closing or side-motion movements. People with TMD may experience these symptoms:
<ul>
	<li>pain in or around the ear</li>
	<li>headaches and neck aches</li>
	<li>tenderness of the jaw or jaw muscles</li>
	<li>jaw pain or soreness that is more prevalent in the morning or late afternoon</li>
	<li>jaw pain when chewing, biting or yawning</li>
	<li>difficulty opening and closing the mouth</li>
	<li>clicking or popping noises when opening the mouth</li>
	<li>sensitive teeth when no other dental problems can be found.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What causes TMD?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Arthritis</li>
	<li>Improper bite (how teeth fit together)</li>
	<li>Jaw dislocation or injury</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stress and TMD</h2>
Stress is thought to be a factor in TMD. Even strenuous physical tasks, such as lifting a heavy object or stressful situations, can aggravate TMD by causing overuse of jaw muscles, specifically clenching or grinding teeth (also known as bruxism).
<h2>What can I do to treat TMD?</h2>
Diagnosis is an important step before treatment. However, because the exact causes and symptoms of TMD are not clear, diagnosing these disorders can be confusing. At present, there is no widely accepted, standard test to correctly identify TMD.

Other dental conditions, such as a toothache or sinus problems, can cause similar symptoms. Scientists are also exploring how behavioral, psychological and physical factors may combine to cause TMD.

Your dentist may also take x-rays and make a cast of your teeth to see how your bite fits together, or may request specialized x-rays for the TM joints. Your complete medical history may be reviewed, so it is important to keep your dental office record up-to-date.

Your dentist will recommend what type of treatment is needed for your particular problem or refer you to a specialist, such as specially trained facial pain experts. You may also want to check with your physician about TMD-type symptoms.

Your dentist may also recommend one of the following:

<strong>Modify the pain.</strong> This can mean resting the joint, taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, or applying moist heat to the painful areas.

<strong>Practice relaxation techniques.</strong> Biofeedback or relaxation training may help to manage stress. Your dentist may prescribe a nightguard to prevent your teeth from grinding during sleep.

<strong>Fix poorly aligned teeth.</strong> Your dentist may suggest some adjustment, including orthodontic treatment, to correct teeth alignment.

<h1>Night Guard</h1>
<strong>What is a Night guard</strong>
A nightguard is a mouthpiece custom fitted to your mouth, to help alleviate the symptoms of TMJ or bruxism. It is commonly made of a hard or soft plastic. You should wear it at night.

<strong>What does it take to make me a Night guard?</strong>
We will take an impression, at the first appointment and deliver the nightguard at the second appointment. Sometimes it is necessary to have a third appointment for adjustments.</div>
