<h1>Crown or Bridge</h1>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Inlays and Onlays</h1>
In certain cases, inlays and onlays are a conservative alternative to full coverage dental crowns. Also known as indirect fillings, inlays and onlays offer a well-fitting, stronger, longer lasting reparative solution to tooth decay or similar damage. These restorations are beneficial from both an esthetic and functional point of view.

Inlays and onlays can often be used in place of traditional dental fillings to treat tooth decay or similar structural damage. Whereas dental fillings are molded into place within the mouth during a dental visit, inlays and onlays are fabricated indirectly in a dental lab before being fitted and bonded to the damaged tooth by your dentist.

The restoration is dubbed an "inlay" when the material is bonded within the center of a tooth. Conversely, the restoration is dubbed an "onlay" when the extent of the damage requires inclusion of one or more cusps (points) of the tooth or full coverage of the biting surface.
<h1>Porcelain crown</h1>
porcelain crown or jacket crown or metal free crown made of zirconium or aluminium-oxide and seems to be the most modern fixed dental restoration work in aesthetic dentistry.
Crowns are an ideal way to rebuild teeth which have been broken, or which have been weakened by decay or a very large filling.
The crown fits over the remaining part of the tooth, making it strong and giving it the shape and the contour of a natural tooth.

<strong>Why have Full Porcelain Crowns?</strong>

Full Porcelain Crowns are sometimes recommended by the dentist for restoration work of upper and/or lower front teeth. In aesthetic terms Full Porcelain Crowns are superior to Porcelain Fused to Metal/Gold Crowns because they are produced using full porcelain thus allowing for a more natural appearance.
<h1>Emax</h1>
The E-Max crown is a type of all-ceramic crown which is preferred for its longer lasting, aesthetic qualities. This crown and the Zirconia crown are worn due to their highly attractive appearance which ensures that they compliment the rest of your teeth.

It is considered a good option for damaged, stained or poor quality teeth.

<strong>WHAT IS AN E-MAX CROWN?</strong>

This is a type of all-ceramic crown with an appealing translucent colour which is combined with extra strength and durability.

This crown is made from a single block of lithium disilicate ceramic: this is a top grade material which has been harvested for its toughness, durability and opaque qualities which makes it a highly prized crown.
<h1>Zirconia</h1>
Zirconia (Zirconium Oxide) is a white powdered metal used to create dental frameworks for crowns, bridges and other dental substructures. It replaces gold or stainless steel used in the past, creates the appearance of a whiter more translucent tooth, and is transparent in xrays. Zirconia has been in use in cosmetic dentistry for many years to acheive the most aesthetic result possible, but has more recently become widely accepted as the dental material of choice.

Zirconia Crowns: Zirconia is the best material available for bridges and for creating a strong translucent tooth that rivals all-porcelain crowns.
